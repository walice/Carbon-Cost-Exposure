# Carbon-Cost-Exposure
Analyzing the material vs. ideological basis of opposition to carbon pricing


### To replicate results and figures
Clone this repository and run `postBuild.sh`. This script will create folders for *Data*, *Figures* and *Results*, download the raw data, and then execute the script `replicate.sh` to generate the figures and results.

```
git clone https://github.com/walice/Carbon-Cost-Exposure.git
cd Carbon-Cost-Exposure
chmod u+x postBuild.sh
./postBuid.sh
```

### To replicate the computational environment
If you use Docker, you can use the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` which are included in this repo to emulate the computational environment that was used to perform this analysis. These files will allow you to build an image which includes all the required dependencies and packages.

Docker will spin up an image which provides JupyterLab and RStudio via browser access. The image builds on the template https://github.com/walice/jupyter-rstudio-binder. If you just want to download the computational environment, you can use the template.

First, clone the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/walice/Carbon-Cost-Exposure.git
cd Carbon-Cost-Exposure
```

Second, run the `setup.sh` script. This will set up a password utility so that you can access the computational environment via your browser.

```
chmod u+x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

Enter your chosen password twice to confirm it.

Third, build the Docker container.

```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Finally, run `postBuild.sh` as described above.

```
chmod u+x postBuild.sh
./postBuid.sh
```
